This directory contains a LaTeX document class, cv.cls, written for
Chi-kwan Chan's Curriculum Vitae, and a simple example that uses it.

The document class is based on article.cls.  I have a \makeinfo macro
instead of using \maketitle.  I also redefine \part[]{} and \part*{}
so they set the page heading.  There are also two list environments,
"tlist" for tabbed list and "ilist" for enumerate list with inverse
numbering.

cv.cls is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
